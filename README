# WebGL Boxes

## Things missing

- collisions (simple to implement, will be trying convex-hull in a future projects),
- shadow mapping (if I ever attempt to implement it, it must be cascaded shadow mapping with PCF)
- skinning (have to extend current GLTF importer to load them)

## Things to reconsider

- shaders definition - currently there is too much redudunt information specfied - probably a unified 'shader interface' for all materials will prove more reliable
- WebGL2 - it's widely available nowadays, itegrates alot of extensions from WebGL1 into core
